# Projects
These are the personal and academic projects or workshops I have done throughout my learning & exploring journey to acquire new skills, concepts, technologies, languages, and much more to motivate me to grow knowledgeably in the field of Cybersecurity, UI/UX, and much more.

# [ SOC-30: Day Challeneges ](https://github.com/RISHIISVERYCOOL/Cyber-Sec/tree/main/SOC-30%20Day%20Challenege)
This training helped me gain knowledge not only theoretically but also practically, to immerse myself in real-world challenges and help me understand what an SOC Analyst goes through in their daily routine. It helped me explore various topics in the field of SOC Analysis, which are Windows Event Management and analysis using **Windows Event Viewer**, Linux Log Analysis using **Splunk**, Packet Analysis & Network Protocols using **Wireshark**, Phishing-Malware Analysis & Threat Intelligence using **OSINT tools**, **MITRE ATT&CK** &  EDR using **Wazooh**.

# [Campus Immersive Street View](https://github.com/RISHIISVERYCOOL/Cyber-Sec/tree/main/Campus%20Immersive%20Street%20View)
This is a personal project that was done with the help of the **Figma** design software. It was done to show and give a feel to the viewers who are willing to be the next successful students of the university.
